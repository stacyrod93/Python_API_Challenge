# Python_API_Challenge
The purpose of this project is to use data from https://openweathermap.org/api to determine waht happens to the weather as we approach the euqator. 
There were two Python notebooks used 

*WeatherPY

For this assignment I first build a series of scatter plots that show cased the following information

  * Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
  * Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
  * Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
  * Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
  
 One that was completed I used linear regression on each of these relationships divided by Northern and Southern Hemisphere 
  * Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
  * Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
  * Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
  * Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
  * Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
  * Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
  * Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
  * Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
  
  *VacationPy
   Uses the data from the WeatherPY notebook to analyze weather in different cities 
   
    *A max temperature lower than 80 degrees but higher than 70.
    * Wind speed less than 10 mph.
    * Zero cloudiness.
